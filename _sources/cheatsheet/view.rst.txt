Viewing Molecules
=================

:mod:`sire` has integrations with
`NGLView <https://nglviewer.org>`__ and
`RDKit <https://www.rdkit.org>`__ to enable you to easily create
two dimensional and three dimensional views of molecules. These
are available via the :func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view2d` and
:func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view` functions that are available for
every molecule, molecule view, collection and system object.
Calling :func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view2d` or
:func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view` will view whatever molecular data
is contained within that object in either 2D or 3D.

2D Views
--------

Creating 2D structure views is very straightforward. Simply
call the :func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view2d` member function
of the object that contains the molecular data you want to view.

For example, (in a Jupyter notebook or similar)
you can view individual molecules...

>>> import sire as sr
>>> mols = sr.load(sr.expand(sr.tutorial_url, "ala.top", "ala.crd"))
>>> mol = mols[0]
>>> mol.view2d()

.. image:: images/view_01.png
   :alt: Chemical structure of aladip

or parts of molecules.

>>> res = mol["residx 1"]
>>> res.view2d()

.. image:: images/view_02.png
   :alt: Chemical structure of the second residue of aladip

.. note::

   Note that the charge and bond state of partial molecules may be
   incorrect. This is because the algorithm that assigns charges
   and bonds will see that the atoms whose bonds have been broken
   are missing electrons in their valence shell. The algorithm will
   try to correct this by adding or removing extra bonds, or adding
   or removing electrons from those atoms.

You can even view collections of molecules. In this case, molecules are
grouped together by structure, and you see the number of each type of
molecules in the collection.

>>> mols.view2d()

.. image:: images/view_03.png
   :alt: Chemical structure of aladip in water

By default, the molecules are printed in a single column. You can
print the molecules across multiple columns by setting their number
via the ``num_columns`` argument, e.g.

>>> mols.view2d(num_columns=2)

.. image:: images/view_04.png
   :alt: Chemical structure of aladip in water shown in two columns

If you aren't working in a Jupyter notebook (or similar), or if you want
to save the images to a file, simply pass your desired filename as the
``filename`` argument, e.g.

>>> mols.view2d(filename="structure.png")
/path/to/structure.png'

This returns the full path to the image that was created. The image format
will be chosen based on the file extension. Supported formats are
SVG (``.svg``), PNG (``.png``) and PDF (``.pdf``). Note that you may need
to install the ``cairosvg`` library to save to PNG or PDF. If you don't
have this installed, then a warning will be printed and the image will
be saved in SVG format (with the file extension changed to ``.svg``).

By default, the image size for both displaying in a notebook and saving
to a file is 750x300 pixels for single-molecule views, and
750x600 pixels for multi-molecule views. You can control the image size
via the ``height`` and ``width`` options, e.g.

>>> mols.view2d(filename="structure.png", height=1000, width=1000)
/path/to/structure.png'

Also, by default, this structure view will only include hydrogens where
they are needed to resolve any ambiguities. Unambiguous hydrogens are
not shown. You can view them by passing ``include_hydrogens==True``, e.g.

>>> mol.view2d(include_hydrogens=True)

.. image:: images/view_05.png
   :alt: Chemical structure of aladip including hydrogens

The bond state (single, double, aromatic etc.), formal charge and
stereochemistry of the atoms and bonds in the molecule(s) is determined
automatically if this information is not present within the
molecule(s)'s properties. A simple, yet effective algorithm
`described here <https://docs.mdanalysis.org/2.0.0/_modules/MDAnalysis/converters/RDKit.html#_infer_bo_and_charges>`__
has been copied into :mod:`sire`. This algorithm loops over atoms
and adds or removes bonds and electrons such until each atom has filled
its valence shell. The stereochemistry is determined using the
`AssignStereochemistryFrom3D <https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.html#rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.AssignStereochemistryFrom3D>`__
function from RDKit, based on the coordinates in the ``coordinates``
property. As with all of :mod:`sire`, you can change the properties
used to find information from a molecule by passing in a property
map via the ``map`` argument of :func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view2d`.


3D Views
--------

Creating 3D views is similarly straightforward. Simply call
the :func:`~sire.mol.SelectorMol.view` function on the object
that contains the molecule data you want to view. This will start
an interactive 3D viewer that you can use to rotate, translate and
zoom around. If the molecule has multiple trajectory frames, then
you will also get video player controls to play, pause, stop and
scroll through an animation of each frame.

.. note::

   3D views can only be created within Jupyter notebooks (or similar).
   There is no option currently to let you save the image to a file.

You can view individual molecules...

>>> import sire as sr
>>> mols = sr.load(sr.expand(sr.tutorial_url, "ala.top", "ala.crd"))
>>> mol = mols[0]
>>> mol.view()

.. image:: images/view_06.jpg
   :alt: 3D view of aladip

parts of molecules...

>>> res = mol["residx 1"]
>>> res.view()

.. image:: images/view_07.jpg
   :alt: 3D view of the second residue in aladip

or even whole collections of molecules.

>>> mols.view()

.. image:: images/view_08.jpg
   :alt: 3D view of aladip in water

By default, the 3D view is orthographic. You can switch to a perspective
view by passing ``orthographic=False``, e.g.

>>> mol.view(orthographic=False)

.. image:: images/view_09.jpg
   :alt: 3D perspective view of aladip

You can control the representation used for the view via the additional
arguments of the function.

* ``protein`` - set the representation used for protein molecules
* ``water`` - set the representation used for water molecules
* ``ion`` - set the representation used for single-atom ions
* ``rest`` - set the representation used for all other molecules (e.g. ligands)

You can also force all molecules to use the same representation by
setting the ``all`` option.

There are several representations that you can use. These are:

* ``ball_and_stick`` - a ball and stick view
* ``cartoon`` - traditional "cartoon" view of a protein
* ``licorice`` - prettier line view
* ``line`` - simple line view
* ``point`` - simple point for each atom
* ``ribbon`` - show the protein backbone as a ribbon
* ``rocket`` - rocket view
* ``rope`` - show the backbone as a rope
* ``spacefill`` - Spacefilled spheres for each atom
* ``surface`` - Render the molecular surface only
* ``trace`` - trace view
* ``tube`` - show the backbone as a rope

So setting ``protein="tube"`` would render protein molecules with a
``tube`` representation. Setting ``all="spacefill"`` would render
all atoms using a ``spacefill`` representation etc.

The following default representations will be used:

* ``protein`` - ``cartoon``
* ``water`` - ``line``
* ``ion`` - ``spacefill``
* ``rest`` - ``licorice``

You can switch off the default representations by passing
``no_default=True``, e.g. ``mols.view(no_default=True, protein="surface")``
would show only the surface view of a protein.

You can also pass multiple representations per view by passing in a
list of representations, e.g.

>>> mols = sr.load("3NSS")
>>> mols.view(protein=["tube", "licorice"])

.. image:: images/view_10.jpg
   :alt: Tube and licorice view of the protein in 3NSS

views the protein with both a ``licorice`` and a ``tube`` representation.

The terms ``protein``, ``water`` and ``ion`` are performing searches
of the molecule(s) for all atoms that match those search terms.
You can create your own selections by passing in search terms for
arguments that match the representation. For example

>>> mols.view(spacefill="resname ALA")

.. image:: images/view_11.jpg
   :alt: Cartoon view of 3NSS with ALA residues in spacefill

will render the protein in default view (``cartoon``) and will additionally
render every atom that matches ``resname ALA`` in ``spacefill``.

You can match multiple search terms by passing them in as a list, e.g.
``mols.view(spacefill=["resname ALA", "resname ASP"])`` would render
both ``ALA`` and ``ASP`` residues in ``spacefill``.

You can use :doc:`any search term <search>` against any of the representations.
For example, here we will do a more complex view of the ``aladip`` system
where we render water molecules that are close to ``aladip`` differently
to the rest of the water molecules in the box.

>>> mols = sr.load(sr.expand(sr.tutorial_url, "ala.top", "ala.crd"))
>>> mols.view(no_default=True,
...           surface="molidx 0",
...           spacefill="water within 5 of molidx 0",
...           ball_and_stick="water within 10 of molidx 0",
...           rest="line")

.. image:: images/view_12.jpg
   :alt: Views of water around aladip

.. note::

   Note how the distance calculation takes into account the periodic
   boundaries of the system. Note also that you can mix representation
   based views (e.g. ``surface="molidx 0"``) with search based views
   (e.g. ``rest="line"``).

Currently there isn't an ability to control the colour or opacity
(transparency) of the different views. This is something that we would
like to add. Please get in touch if you have a good idea of how this
could be expressed in the API, or if you would like to have a go at
implementing this functionality.

Also, we don't yet properly expose the
`NGLView stage parameters <https://github.com/nglviewer/nglview/blob/master/README.md#properties>`__.
Currently you can pass in a dictionary of parameters via the
``stage_parameters`` argument, which are straight passed to the
``NGLView.NGLWidget.stage``.

If you want more control over the view, you can assign the result
of ``mols.view(...)`` to a variable. This variable is the actual
`NGLView.NGLWidget <https://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html#nglview.NGLWidget>`__,
which you can manipulate as if you had created it yourself, e.g.

>>> v = mols[0].view()
>>> v.stage.set_parameters(backgroundColor="white")
>>> v.display(gui=True)
>>> v.camera = "perspective"
>>> v
