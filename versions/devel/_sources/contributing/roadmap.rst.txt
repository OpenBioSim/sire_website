Roadmap
=======

:mod:`sire` is a well established foundational package for other software,
such as `BioSimSpace <https://biosimspace.org>`__.

Our plan is to make :mod:`sire` easier to use. We will do this
by adding lots of tutorials, and simplifying the API so that it is
easier to do what you want, without having to learn a lot of classes.

:mod:`sire` does have a few rough edges. These reflect its history as a
prototyping code, in which many new molecular simulation ideas were
developed and deployed over 10-15 years. Our plan now is to smooth
those rough edges, and work to clean away dead code or little-used
functionality.

This should leave :mod:`sire` as an excellent tool for loading, editing,
manipulating and performing calculations on molecules. We will retain
the molecular simulation parts, as these may be useful for someone
in the future. But, predominantly, we will focus :mod:`sire` as a flexible
and powerful tool for loading and manipulating molecules, and as a
useful companion tool to `BioSimSpace <https://biosimspace.org>`__.

If you would like to suggest features that should be
added to the roadmap then please
`raise a feature request here <https://github.com/openbiosim/sire/issues/new?assignees=chryswoods&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE+REQUEST%5D+-+I%27d+like+Sire+to>`_.

More details about individual feature branches, which contain the new
features being actively worked on, is available on the
`GitHub issues <https://github.com/openbiosim/sire/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afeature-branch>`_
page.
