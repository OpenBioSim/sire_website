Development of :mod:`sire` is an ongoing process involving many people.
This section of the documentation is a collection of diary-style
blog posts that describe the development of :mod:`sire` and
new features as they are added.

What's in a file? Using sire search
-----------------------------------

* `What's in a file? Using sire search <https://www.openbiosim.org/ten-minute-sire-challenge/>`__

In this first post, written around the 2023.1 release,
we describe the :doc:`sire search <cheatsheet/search>`
functionality that enables :mod:`sire` to act like a molecular information
search engine.

Working with RDKit
------------------

* `Working with RDKit <https://www.openbiosim.org/working-with-rdkit/>`__

In this second post, written around the 2023.2 release,
we show how :doc:`integration with RDKit <tutorial/part05/03_smiles>`
enables :mod:`sire` to work with SMILES strings and RDKit molecules.

Working with OpenMM
-------------------

* `Working with OpenMM <https://www.openbiosim.org/sire-diaries-working-with-openmm/>`__

In this third post, also written around the 2023.2 release,
we show how :doc:`integration with OpenMM <tutorial/part05/05_dynamics>`
enables :mod:`sire` to perform GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics simulations.

GPU-accelerated free energies
-----------------------------

* `GPU-accelerated free energies <https://www.openbiosim.org/sire-diaries-gpu-free-energy/>`__

In this fourth post, written around the 2023.4 release,
we show how the OpenMM integration has been extended to
enable the :doc:`calculation of free energies <tutorial/index_part06>`.
